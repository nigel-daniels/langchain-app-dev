Overview
--------

LangChain is an OSS framework for developing LLM packages.
Offers Python and JS packages.
Focuses on composition and modularity.
The key value adds are:
    Modular components.
    Use cases: common ways to combine components.

Components
----------

Modules
- LLMs: 20+ integrations
- Chat models
- Text embedding models: 10+ integrations

Prompts
- Prompt templates
- Output parsers: 5+ implementations
    - Retry/fixing logic
- Example selectors: 5+ implementations

Indexes
- Document loaders: 50+ implementations
- Text splitters: 10+ implementations
- Vector stores: 10+ integrations
- Retrievers: 5+ integrations/implementations

Chains
- Prompt + LLM + Output parsing
- Can be used as building blocks for longer chains
- More application specific chains: 20+ types

Agents
- Agent types: 5+ types
    - Algorithms for getting LLMs to use tools
- Agent toolkits: 10+ implementations
    - Agents armed with specific tools for a specific application
