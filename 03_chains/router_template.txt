Given a raw text input to a language model select the model prompt best suited for the input. You will be given the names of the available prompts and a description of what the prompt is best suited for. You may also revise the original input if you think that revising it will ultimately lead to a better response from the language model.

<< FORMATTING >>
{format_instructions}

REMEMBER: "destination" MUST be one of the candidate prompt names specified below OR it can be "DEFAULT" if the input is not well suited for any of the candidate prompts.
REMEMBER: "next_inputs" can just be the original input if you don't think any modifications are needed.
