Based on the input question to an large language model take the following steps:
1) decide if the question can be answered by any of the destinations based on the destination descriptions.
2) If none of the destinations are a good fit use "DEFAULT" as the response, For example if the question is about pharmacology but there is no "health care" destination use DEFAULT.
3) Check is set to DEFAULT, if there is no match or set it to DEFAULT.
4) You may also revise the original input if you think that revising it will ultimately lead to a better response from the language model.

You ONLY have the following destinations to choose from:
<Destinations>
{destinations}
<Destinations>

This is the question provided:
<Input>
{input}
<Input>

When you respond be sure to use the following format:
<Formatting>
{format_instructions}
<Formatting>

IMPORTANT: "destination" MUST be one of the destination names provided OR it can be "DEFAULT" if there is no good match.
IMPORTANT: "next_inputs" can just be the original input if you don't think any modifications are needed.
