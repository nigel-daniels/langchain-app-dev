Templates
---------

Templates allow us to construct prompts that we can reuse many times.
Also LangChain provides multiple prompts libraries to achieve different tasks,
such as connecting to a database, etc.


LangChain output parsing and prompt templates
---------------------------------------------
The LangChain library functions can parse the LLM output assuming it will use
certain keywords. For example it could look for the keywords:
-Thought
-Action
-Observation

These are keywords for the Chain-of-Thought Reasoning (ReAct).

A prompt looking for the key words can be coupled with a parser.
